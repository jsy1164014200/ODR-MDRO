* Starting YALMIP global branch & bound.
* Upper solver     : fmincon
* Lower solver     : MOSEK
* LP solver        : MOSEK
* -Extracting bounds from model
* -Perfoming root-node bound propagation
* -Calling upper solver (found a solution, objective -2414.9074)
* -Branch-variables : 404
* -More root-node bound-propagation
* -Performing LP-based bound-propagation 
* -And some more root-node bound-propagation
* Starting the b&b process
